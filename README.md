# INSAR-MONet
This repository contains the testing code of [InSAR-MONet: Interferometric SAR phase
denoising using a multi-objective neural network](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9961176)., a CNN based solution for Interferometric SAR Phase denoising.

if you find it usefule and use it for you research, please cite as the following:

InSAR-MONet inherits the 17 layers CNN architectures and the concept of using a multi-objective cost function from [MONet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9261137).

The cost function is composed of three terms taking care of spatial and statistical properties of the interferometric phase: a cosine based metric for evaluating similarity between output and reference, a gradient based metric for edges preservation and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between estimated noise distribution and the theoretical one.

# Usage 
* **data** folder contains three samples images with simulated interferometric SAR phases (corresponding to the examples of the paper);
Three differente cases can be tested:
     * small baseline and high coherence (B1, Gamma 4)
     * medium baseline and medium coherence (B2, Gamma 3)
     * large baseline and low coherence (B4, Gamma 1)

* *model* contains trained weigths
* *model.py* contains the model implementation
* *testing.py* is the main script for testing

# Prerequisites
This code is written on Ubuntu system for Python3.7 and uses Pytorch library.

For a correct usage of the code, please install the python environement saved in **./env/monet_pytorch.yml** with the following step:

**Installing Anaconda** (if not already installed)

1. download anaconda3 from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#linux
2. from command line, move to the download directory and install the package by:
> sh <Anaconda_downloaded_version>.sh 
and follow the instruction for installation
3. add conda to path
> PATH=~/anaconda3/bin:$PATH

**Installing the conda environment**

The file ./insarmonet_env.yml contains the environemnt for the testing the code. You can easily installing it by command line:

1. move to the folder containing the github repository and open the terminal
2. run the following command
 > conda env create -f insarmonet_env.yml


Once environment has been set up, activate it by command line as well:

1. activate the environemnt from the command line

> conda activate insarmonet_env

2. launch spyder

> spyder

3. goes to the folder containing **testing.py**, edit and run
